# scalableSamplingMJPs
Scalable auxiliary-variable samplers for population Markov jump processes

This repository includes data and code allowing to reproduce results within the following manuscript:

Perez, I., and Kypraios, T. â€“ Scalable auxiliary-variable augmentation and Bayesian inference with population Markov jump processes

All C++ code to be compiled with flags -O3 -pthread (to allow for optimizations and multi-threading).

For any queries, please contact Dr. Iker Perez at iker.perez@nottingham.ac.uk.
